# Crossy Road GBA - By Bram Plessers and Arne Niesten

## Crossy Road GBA Clone using [GBA-Sprite-Engine](https://github.com/wgroeneveld/gba-sprite-engine)

The GBA-Sprite-Engine on which this game is build can be found via the hyperlink above. And is created by Groeneveld, W., Tielemans, J. and Alfonso, R. The GBA-Sprite-Engine is a high-level object-oriented Gameboy Advance sprite engine library that uses C++ 11 object-oriented approach. The project is forked from this engine.
## Course Information [INFCP_3433]
The course called: "Softwareontwerp met C/C++ [INFCP_3433]" at Hasselt University given by [Groeneveld W.](https://github.com/wgroeneveld) required us to make a GBA game using the above mentioned GBA engine. The project assignment consists of the following minimum requirements:
1. The code will be available in a repository on Github under your own username with the [MIT](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#disclaimer) license.
2. You'll start from the [GBA-Sprite-Engine](https://github.com/wgroeneveld/gba-sprite-engine) and you will stay within `MODE0` and work with sprites. C++11 is also a requirement.
3. In case you use others people code, use **source reference!** Plagiarism will be punished badly.
4. Your project needs to compile.
5. Your repository `README.md` contains a small functional description of the game.
6. Beside the functional description you'll  also upload a sketch of your **domain model**, in combination with an explanation.

The source code for our game can be found under `crossy_road` -> `src`.
